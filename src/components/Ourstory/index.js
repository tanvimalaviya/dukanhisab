          Dukanhisab started with a simple vision: to make store management
          easier for every shopkeeper. We saw how small & medium businesses
          struggled with tracking expenses, dues, and accounts. So, we decided
          to build an app that’s simple, reliable, and accessible to all —
          helping shopkeepers save time and grow their business without stress.
